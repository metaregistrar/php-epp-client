Object-oriented PHP EPP Client

Welcome to the object-oriented EPP client in PHP project. 

This project supports the following:
------------------------------------
- Full EPP 57xx RFC standard
- Fully extensible PHP objects to add registry-specific extensions
- Rock-solid object-oriented programming, object inheritance and exception handling
- Interface tested and in use with a registrar that handles 600.000+ domain names
- Public/private key client certificates for connecting to EPP service (for example see Registries/IIS)
- Connection to EPP via HTTP/SSL (for example see Registries/Openprovider)
- DNSSEC transactions
- Registry sunrise, landrush and claims periods (draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase)
- TMCH CNIS retrieval examples with standard ICANN registrar message

This code will provide you with a fully functional EPP client to connect to any registry world-wide that supports EPP.

All code is organized in objects, so connecting to a new registry is just a matter of object re-use and extension.

Sample registry connections are provided in the Registries directory.

Example scipts in the main directory:
-------------------------------------
checkdomain.php        - check one domain name
timeddomaincheck.php   - check multiple domain names and check how fast the registry is
registerdomain.php     - register a domain name
changepassword.php     - change EPP password
infodomain.php         - get information on a domain name
modifydomain.php       - update a domain name with new info
createcontact.php      - create a contact object
updatecontact.php      - update contact details of a created contact object
registerdomain.php     - register a domain name in general availability phase
signdomain.php         - DNSSEC sign a domain name
poll.php               - list registry poll messages and confirm a message
checklaunchdomain.php  - check domain name in 'claims' phase of draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase and check if the domain is free
createlaunchdomain.php - register domain name in 'claims' phase of draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase
checktmchdomain.php    - check domain name in the 'claims' phase and check if the domain has a claim and retrieve the cnis info from the TMCH
test-claim.php         - connect to the TMCH test service and retrieve the list of domain names, query cnis info and display icann std warning msg
createclaimeddomain.php - create domain name that has a tmch claim in the claims phase of the launch

How to use this repository
--------------------------
- Check out the latest version from github
- Use the Examples/checkdomain.php and create a connection to your favorite registry (for example new Metaregistrar\EPP\metaregEppConnection())
- Create a settings.ini in Registries/metaregEppConnection with the following contents:
hostname=ssl://epp.test2.metaregistrar.com
port=7443
userid=xxxxxxxx
password=xxxxxxxxx
- Now, checkdomain.php should be functioning and checking domains.

If you do not want to use settings.ini files in the Registries directory, you can create a connection as follows:
$conn = Metaregistrar\EPP\metaregEppConnection();
$conn->setHostname('ssl://epp.test2.metaregistrar.com'); // Hostname may vary depending on the registry selected
$conn->setPort(7443); // Port may vary depending on the registry selected
$conn->setUsername('xxxxxxxx');
$conn->setPassword('xxxxxxxxx');
